# Notes App

This is a simple notes taking app that allows you to create, edit, and delete notes.

## Features

- Create new notes with a title and content
- Edit existing notes
- Delete notes
- Persist notes to local storage so they are saved across page refreshes

## Usage

To use the app, simply open the `index.html` file in your browser.

You can then:

- Type a title and content into the inputs to create a new note
- Click on a note in the left sidebar to view it 
- Click the edit icon on an existing note to edit it
- Click the delete icon to delete a note

The notes are saved to `localStorage` so they will persist across page refreshes.

## Code Overview

The app is split into two main JavaScript files:

- `notes.js` - This handles creating, editing, deleting notes and interfacing with `localStorage`
- `app.js` - This file handles the UI and DOM manipulation of the app

The `Notes` class in `notes.js` handles the note data model and `localStorage` integration.
The `App` class in `app.js` handles rendering notes to the DOM and handling user input.

Some key aspects:

- The Notes class uses the `uuid` package to generate unique IDs for each note
- `localStorage` is used to save and retrieve notes
- Event delegation is used for editing & deleting notes
- Web storage APIs are used for persisting data

## Possible Improvements

Some ideas for improving the app in the future:

- Add categorization for notes
- Include rich text editing for note content
- Add search capability 
- Sync between devices using a server
